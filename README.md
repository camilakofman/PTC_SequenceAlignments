# PTC_SequenceAlignments

This repository contains the phylogenetic analysis code used in the publication xxxxxxx, adapted from https://github.com/adamhockenberry/23s-alignment-LTP. 

The data is downloaded from the All Species Living Tree Project and consists of two files (identical to those shown in the respository listed above): LTPs123_LSU_tree.newick and LTPs123_LSU_aligned.fasta

The code to make plots and analyze sequence conservation of regions of interest within the 23S rRNA-- it can be found at SequenceAlignmentPlots_CK.py.

This code is written in python 3.0. Other requirements are relatively standard scientific packages (scipy, numpy, pandas) as well as Biopython.

Questions can be addressed to ckofman@u.northwestern.edu
